amazon price changes -> order

how amazon or any e-commerce website changes the prices of product.
because let suppose a product is placed and order is delivered so in database it has older value, then due to festival season prices are dropped, now let suppose if i change prices of product in database, then the order which are already delivered the prices of that order will also be changed by lower prices.
but this is not accesseptable.
so what they are actually doing when price drop or higher price applied on products.
it should maintain consistency in product price and also in order table.
how they are accually implement this type of situaltions?


E-commerce platforms like Amazon use a separate pricing mechanism and order history system to handle dynamic pricing while maintaining price consistency for past orders. Here's how they achieve this:

1. Price Stored Separately in Orders Table
When an order is placed, the system copies the product price at the time of purchase into the Orders table. Even if the price of the product changes later, the order still shows the original purchase price.

Example Database Structure
Products Table (Stores current product details)

| product_id | name      | current_price | stock |
|------------|----------|---------------|-------|
| 101        | Laptop   | 1000          | 20    |
| 102        | Phone    | 800           | 30    |

Orders Table (Stores the historical price)

| order_id | product_id | purchased_price | quantity | order_date  |
|----------|------------|----------------|----------|------------|
| 5001     | 101        | 1000           | 1        | 2024-04-03 |
| 5002     | 102        | 800            | 2        | 2024-04-02 |


Here, purchased_price is recorded when the order is placed.

Even if current_price changes in the Products table, the Orders table remains unchanged.
